# HokieMusic

This is the Hokie Music App.

Use the spinners to choose which song you would like to play. The song poster will update corresponding to the app that you choose. 
You may also use the spinner for the sound effects to determine which sound effect you would like for effect 1,2, or 3.
Use their corresponding seek bars to determine where the effects will be placed in the song.

You may start, pause, or restart the song after you are redirected to the playing screen. The song will continually play whether you 
leave the app or use another, as long you do not pause it. It will stop playing after you go back to the editting screen.

All buttons, spinners, and seek bar interactions will be POST requested
to server https://webhook.site/6fc64cf9-067d-437a-94ec-8a9d999b0d5d.

Enjoy
